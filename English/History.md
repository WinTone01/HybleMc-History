The kingdoms of the island, which lived in peace and tranquility for many years, faced a dark force. The Middle Kingdom was suddenly exposed to attacks and faced great danger. The curse of the young princess Amateratsu was one of the greatest calamities ever to befall the kingdom. The mage's powerful magic turned Amateratsu into a monster and killed almost all the inhabitants of the kingdom. Her father is left unsure of what to do with the transformation of his princess, and the future of the Island Kingdoms is in jeopardy. The king began looking for a team from all over the island to bring his daughter back. Those in the Northern Kingdom were a mighty warrior, those in the east were a fast archer, those in the west were a master swordsman, and those in the south were good mages. Those who heard the king's call came to the Middle Kingdom to request to join the team. The king accepted the stronger ones from the incoming teams and sent them to save his daughter, but all the outgoing teams were insufficient and died. Meanwhile, Amateratsu continued to create creatures and attack other kingdoms under the influence of dark forces. Only villages, towns and kingdoms with warriors who had learned to wield magic and sealed weapons survived. Please, hero reading this, go get stronger and assemble a team to help find the sealed, magical weapons and rescue the king's daughter!
