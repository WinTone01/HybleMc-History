The kingdoms of the island, which lived in peace and tranquility for many years, faced a dark force. The Middle Kingdom was suddenly exposed to attacks and faced great danger. The curse of the young princess Amateratsu was one of the greatest calamities ever to befall the kingdom. The mage's powerful magic turned Amateratsu into a monster and killed almost all the inhabitants of the kingdom. Her father is left unsure of what to do with the transformation of his princess, and the future of the Island Kingdoms is in jeopardy.
 The king began looking for a team from all over the island to bring his daughter back. Those in the North Kingdom were a mighty warrior, those in the east a fast archer, those in the west a skilled swordsman, and those in the south a good sorcerer. Hearing the king's call, they came to the Middle Kingdom to join the team. Meanwhile, Amateratsu continued to attack other kingdoms by creating creatures under the influence of dark forces. Only villages, towns and kingdoms with warriors who learned to wield magic and sealed weapons survived.
